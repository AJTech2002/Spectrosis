# Unity Synth
Create a virtual orchestra using a pencil drawing tool to simulate audio waves bouncing around in an object to synthesise new sounds from scratch. Various options supported such as reverb, filters, tremelo etc. all from very simple interactions and controls. Using N-Audio to synthesise audio, and Shapes for drawing and visualisation. This project can be extended further to include more synth controls for a creative and fun approach to generating new sounds.
